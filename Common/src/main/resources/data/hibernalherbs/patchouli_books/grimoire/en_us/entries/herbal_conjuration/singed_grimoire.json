Until an unknown conjurer solved the combination of ingredients needed, and had an Unholy Blessing put upon it. This left the book eternally singed, never to be brought back to it's original state. This Unholy Blessing however provided the book with additional information, said to be a gift from the King of the 7 rings themself."
